# Data availability in studies employing the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP)



## Code directory

Contains an RMarkdown script quantifying the results and the html file it generates.

## Communications directory

Contains 

- docx and pdf copies of the prerprint.
- a dated .csv file produced by statcheck.io, which records the results of statcheck's assessment of potential reporting errors in the docx preprint file.  

## Data directory

Contains:

- a list of the publications returned by the systematic search. 
  - Note that the systematic search was taken from an existing published systematic review of the IRAP literature. All materials needed to reproduce, reuse, or update this search can be found in the supplementary materials of the publication's preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/g2x9p/ 
- a blinded and shuffled copy of the results the data sharing requests ("results of data sharing requests - blinded and shuffled.xlsx"). This file was used to organise the study and record the results, and is used by the analysis.Rmd file to conduct the analyses and create the plots.
- a codebook that explains the columns in the results file.
- Note that an unblinded version of the results file exists ("results of data sharing requests - detailed, not for distribution.xlsx") exists but is not shared. Cells that contain "[censored]" in the blinded file are uncensored in this file, e.g., article name, doi, author list, specific authors contacted. 

## Measures directory

Contains a copy of the email sent to authors.
