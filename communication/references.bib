	abstract = {Evidence for the IRAP’s reliability and validity is mixed, with one meta-analysis concluding it has good criterion validity and potential for clinical assessment, and two others concluding that it demonstrates low reliability. Here, we extend this evidence base through meta-analyses of all published and unpublished studies conducted in two labs. Individual participant data was used to estimate both internal consistency and test-retest reliability across a large number of domains (k = 16) and participants (N = 1576). Results suggest that internal consistency is poor (α = .51, 95\% CI [.46, .56]) and test-retest reliability is very poor (ICC = .20, 95\% CI [.05, .34]). We conclude that researchers should be very cautious about choosing to employ the IRAP or when interpreting its results.},

Many of these solutions were devised by the Databrary.org data library for storing and sharing video, audio, and other forms of sensitive or personally identifiable data. We also discuss ways in which researchers can make shared data and materials easier for others to find and reuse.

	abstract = {Increasing openness, transparency, and reproducibility in contextual behavioral science (CBS) through incorporating CBS-consistent open science practices was identified as a key aim of the ACBS Research Task Force. However, little data exist on the prevalence of open science practices currently being used in CBS research. This study aimed to address this gap by auditing the prevalence of open science and reproducibility practices in studies published in the Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science across 1 year, prior to the journal’s adoption of open science recommendations (July 2020 – July 2021). Aims of the study were twofold: first, to characterize current use of open science and reproducibility practices in JCBS to serve as a point for future comparison; second, to compare the rate of open science and reproducibility practices in JCBS, the flagship journal for contextual behavioral science, against two recently published audits of top clinical psychology journals. Domains audited were use of pre-registration, practices to ensure adequate power, data availability statements, use of standard reporting guidelines, preprints, conflict of interest statements, and resource and code sharing. Results indicated that studies published in JCBS had low rates of pre-registration, data availability statements, preprint posting, and resource and code sharing. Use of mandated standardized reporting guidelines and conflict of interest disclosures, both required by JCBS at the time of the audit, reflected relative strengths. Power for correlational studies was superior to power for experimental studies; the latter reflected a relative weakness compared to other clinical psychology journals. Rates of practices required by JCBS were significantly higher than those not required. JCBS may consider strongly encouraging or mandating other open science practices to incentivize researchers to use them.},

The GDPR elaborates requirements concerning the forms of information that should be communicated to research participants whenever personal data are collected directly from them. There is a general norm that informed consent should be obtained before psychological research involving the collection of personal data directly from research participants is conducted. The information required to be provided under the GDPR is normally communicated in the context of an informed consent procedure. There is reason to believe, however, that the information required by the GDPR may not always be provided. Our aim in this tutorial is thus to provide general practical guidance to psychological researchers allowing them to understand the forms of information that must be provided to research participants under the GDPR in informed consent procedures.},

Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

	abstract = {Following recent calls to examine the replicability of behavioral research, I examined two key determinants of replicability, namely sample sizes and statistical power, in research using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP). A systematic review was used to gather all published studies employing the IRAP and extract their designs and sample sizes. The use of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing was found to be nearly ubiquitous, justifying the examination of statistical power. Using an established method, median sample sizes were used to estimate the statistical power to detect the average published effect size in psychological research (r = .20) in each year. Sample sizes and the statistical power they imply were found to be very low in IRAP studies (in 2022: median N = 64, power = 0.34). At the current rate of growth, the median study will only reach the recommended minimum power of at least 0.80 by 2080. The IRAP literature was directly compared with the Social and Personality psychology literature using an existing dataset. Median sample sizes and their implied statistical power were lower in the IRAP literature in all years than they were in Social and Personality psychology at the beginning of the Replication Crisis in 2011, and indeed in all subsequent years. Improvements in sample sizes and statistical power in the Social and Personality psychology literature were significantly and substantially larger than in the IRAP literature. Direct tests of the reproducibility and replicability of claims in the IRAP literature are needed.},

This student wrote to 37 authors whose journal articles appeared in APA journals between 1959 and 1961. Of these authors, 32 replied. Twenty-one of those reported the data misplaced, lost, or inadvertently destroyed. Two of the remaining 11 offered their data on the conditions that they be notified of our intended use of their data, and stated that they have control of anything that we would publish involving these data. Errors were found in some of the raw data that was obtained which caused a dilemma of either reporting the errors or not. The commentator states that if it were clearly set forth by the APA that the responsibility for retaining raw data and submitting them for scrutiny upon request lies with the author, this dilemma would not exist. The commentator suggests that a possibly more effective means of controlling quality of publication would be to institute a system of quality control whereby random samples of raw data from submitted journal articles would be requested by editors and scrutinized for accuracy and the appropriateness of the analysis performed.

	abstract = {Barnes-Holmes \& Harte (2022) recently provided an account of the history of the development and use of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), and used this account as a springboard for suggestions for future research. Unfortunately, their core assertions are at odds with the published scientific record. This raises questions about the reliability of their recommendations. This reply uses the publications found by an existing systematic review of the published IRAP literature to show that, contrary to Barnes-Holmes \& Harte’s (2022) account, (1) Barnes-Holmes repeatedly and explicitly stated that the IRAP is an implicit measure, and (2) Barnes- Holmes did not “lose control” of the task. Rather, he and his research group have produced the majority of all IRAP publications. The credibility of Barnes-Holmes \& Harte’s (2022) suggestions regarding the future of the IRAP is undermined by their inaccurate account of its past. However, their analogy with Frankenstein’s monster still holds, albeit under an alternative and correct reading of Shelly’s novel as a cautionary tale about scientific recklessness.},

	abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (‘analytic reproducibility’). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

	abstract = {Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2–4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8–11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could ﬁnd a working e-mail address for the ﬁrst, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

	abstract = {Objectives To synthesise research investigating data and code sharing in medicine and health to establish an accurate representation of the prevalence of sharing, how this frequency has changed over time, and what factors influence availability.
Design Systematic review with meta-analysis of individual participant data.
Data sources Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and the preprint servers medRxiv, bioRxiv, and MetaArXiv were searched from inception to 1 July 2021. Forward citation searches were also performed on 30 August 2022.
Review methods Meta-research studies that investigated data or code sharing across a sample of scientific articles presenting original medical and health research were identified. Two authors screened records, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted summary data from study reports when individual participant data could not be retrieved. Key outcomes of interest were the prevalence of statements that declared that data or code were publicly or privately available (declared availability) and the success rates of retrieving these products (actual availability). The associations between data and code availability and several factors (eg, journal policy, type of data, trial design, and human participants) were also examined. A two stage approach to meta-analysis of individual participant data was performed, with proportions and risk ratios pooled with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random effects meta-analysis.
Results The review included 105 meta-research studies examining 2 121 580 articles across 31 specialties. Eligible studies examined a median of 195 primary articles (interquartile range 113-475), with a median publication year of 2015 (interquartile range 2012-2018). Only eight studies (8\%) were classified as having a low risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed a prevalence of declared and actual public data availability of 8\% (95\% confidence interval 5\% to 11\%) and 2\% (1\% to 3\%), respectively, between 2016 and 2021. For public code sharing, both the prevalence of declared and actual availability were estimated to be {\textless}0.5\% since 2016. Meta-regressions indicated that only declared public data sharing prevalence estimates have increased over time. Compliance with mandatory data sharing policies ranged from 0\% to 100\% across journals and varied by type of data. In contrast, success in privately obtaining data and code from authors historically ranged between 0\% and 37\% and 0\% and 23\%, respectively.
Conclusions The review found that public code sharing was persistently low across medical research. Declarations of data sharing were also low, increasing over time, but did not always correspond to actual sharing of data. The effectiveness of mandatory data sharing policies varied substantially by journal and type of data, a finding that might be informative for policy makers when designing policies and allocating resources to audit compliance.

Turning to data that have already been collected, I discuss the ethical and regulatory issues raised by sharing data when the consent form either was silent about data sharing or explicitly promised participants that the data would not be shared.

Previous research has quantified low rates of data availability and results reproducibility across the biological and behavioural sciences. Here, we surveyed 560 empirical publications, published between 1955 and 2018 in the social learning literature, a research topic that spans animal behaviour, behavioural ecology, cultural evolution and evolutionary psychology. Data were recoverable online or through direct data requests for 30\% of this sample. Data recovery declines exponentially with time since publication, halving every 6 years, and up to every 9 years for human experimental data. When data for a publication can be recovered, we estimate a high probability of subsequent data usability (87\%), analytical clarity (97\%) and agreement of published results with reproduced findings (96\%). This corresponds to an overall rate of recovering data and reproducing results of 23\%, largely driven by the unavailability or incompleteness of data. We thus outline clear measures to improve the reproducibility of research on the ecology and evolution of social behaviour.},

We found that all 14 articles provided at least some data and six provided analysis code, but only one article was rated to be exactly reproducible, and three were rated as essentially reproducible with minor deviations.
